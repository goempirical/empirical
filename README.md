# Empirical Website
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for Empirical.

## Running a local development server

First, move to the `source/` folder and run the development server:

```bash
cd source
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Generating a static version of the site

### Automatically
You can run the `build.sh` script that will automatically:
- Run a `build` command for Next.js
- Move the built files on the `out` folder to the root of the repo.
- Create and push a new commit to the remote.


### Manually

The following command will generate a static export of the site:
```bash
npm run export
```

Once the command has finished, the static HTML files should be on the `/out` folder.

Since this is a simple website, the static export shouldn't be troublesome.

> Keep in mind there are some [caveats](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) on when exporting a static site using Next.js.

#### Running a static version of the site
You can place the static HTML files generated by Next.js in any static file server. You can also run one using `serve`:

```bash
npx serve out/
```
